# water-Quality-Monitor-and-autofill-system-using-Iot
This project aims to monitor water quality parameters such as pH, TDS, turbidity, and water level using sensors and Arduino, and automatically control water refilling based on tank level. The collected data is sent to the ThingSpeak IoT platform for real-time remote monitoring and analysis.
